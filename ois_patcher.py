Objects in Space (Flat Earth Games) -- unofficial bugfix patcher for
ois.exe (client) and ois_server.exe, which ships alongside it in every
Windows Steam install (needed for hosting or joining co-op games --
singleplayer never touches it).

A collection of verified fixes for the game, consolidated into one
script anyone can point at their own copy of the game. Also installs a
data-only bugfix mod (a scenario-file typo, 33 dead/unreachable data
tokens across 13 character files, and a one-field typo in a character
cosmetics file) via the game's own mod-loader, since it fixes bugs the
exe patch doesn't touch.

None of Flat Earth Games' own asset files are bundled with this
script -- that content is theirs, not this project's. Instead,
apply_data_fixes.py reads each affected file straight out of your own
game install, verifies the exact line it's about to change matches
byte-for-byte what's expected (same discipline as the exe patches
below), and writes only the corrected result into the mod folder. The
game's own content never leaves your machine.

Usage:
    python ois_patcher.py
    python ois_patcher.py "C:\\path\\to\\Objects in Space"
    python ois_patcher.py "C:\\path\\to\\Objects in Space\\ois.exe"
    python ois_patcher.py --list-installs
    python ois_patcher.py --status
    python ois_patcher.py --uninstall
    python ois_patcher.py --update

With no path given, the install is located the same way Patch_OIS.bat
locates it -- Steam's registry keys and default folders, then every
library in libraryfolders.vdf -- extended to cover GOG installs and to
read the folder name out of Steam's own app manifest rather than
assuming it. An explicit path always wins; OIS_TARGET_DIR is consulted
before falling back to a prompt. A folder is only accepted if ois.exe
is actually in it, and if two installs are found the choice is put to
the user rather than guessed at.

Expects apply_data_fixes.py and a "mod" folder containing "oisbugfix"
(just modinfo.txt) next to this script -- ship all of them together (text_fixes.py carries the text corrections) when
distributing this patcher. Skips mod installation with a warning,
rather than failing, if either is missing.

Updating and uninstalling are both driven by the version marker
embedded in the patched exe itself, so the installed state is read off
the file rather than a receipt that can go stale. Run against an
install patched by an older release, the script restores the original
from its backup and re-applies the current fixes, after asking; an
install already at this version is left alone and only its data-only
mod is refreshed. --uninstall reverses everything: stock exes back from
their backups (each verified stock before use, and byte-verified after
writing), mod folder deleted, saves and settings untouched.

Backs up the original alongside itself as "<name>.original-backup"
(created once, on first run -- never overwritten by later runs) and
writes the patched result back to the same path, in place. The mod
install is a separate, additive step (copies files into the game's own
mods/ folder via its supported mod-loader system) that needs no backup
of its own -- it never touches an existing game file in place.

Applies (all client-only, ois.exe):
  - Pirate Hunt scenario crash: missing bounds-check in the ship
    spawn-selection loop, plus a 3-argument format string with only 2
    args passed to it, both causing the same access-violation crash.
  - Music player permanent failure loop: FMOD Sound handle leak in
    SoundEngine::playNewTrack (never releases the previous track).
  - Ship burn-vector spam (three independent contributors): an
    over-strict bit-exact position comparison, a per-frame recompute
    with no "already handled" gate, and a numerical instability in the
    burn-angle calculation itself near a singularity.
  - Mail/PC terminal DEL crash: typing DEL with a name that has no
    extension (e.g. "DEL NEWS") read past the end of the split-argument
    vector. Now reports the game's own "cannot delete system file"
    message. DEL still never deletes anything, as in the original game.
  - "Unknown room" log spam: cycling past a ship's last room repeatedly
    logs an [ERROR], because the existence check itself always logs on
    a miss even when the caller is only asking "does this room exist"
    and already handles a no answer correctly.
  - Rare PDA-open crash: opening the PDA at the exact moment a
    character's portrait is mid-render can collide inside the game's
    (third-party) rendering engine and crash. Rather than patch that
    engine DLL, this ignores the "open PDA" input for that instant
    instead -- pressing it again immediately after works normally.
  - Full Stop docked-state exploit: triggering Full Stop while docked
    silently undocks the ship in every system's eyes except the game's
    own dock/undock bookkeeping -- no fee, no undocking permission
    check, no airlock requirement, because the real Undock command
    never runs.
  - Save-load crash (or hang) on a module identifier that no longer
    resolves -- e.g. a save or hand-edited ship data still referencing
    a module id this same project's own LADAR rename retired. Two
    independent bugs fixed together: a missing null-check on the
    result of resolving the identifier, and a save-file read-position
    desync in the failure path that otherwise turns the crash into a
    hang instead of actually fixing it.

Applies to ois_server.exe (ships alongside ois.exe in every Windows
Steam install):
  - Both halves of the same Pirate Hunt crash as above -- ois.exe and
    ois_server.exe both compile the same vulnerable function, at
    different addresses. Patched separately (own backup, own .ptch
    section); skipped quietly in the rare case it's genuinely missing
    (e.g. a modified install).

Every patch site's original bytes are verified before being touched; if
they don't match (wrong game version, already patched, modded some
other way), the affected patch is skipped with a warning rather than
guessing -- this script never overwrites bytes it hasn't confirmed it
understands. All absolute addresses used by injected code are computed
at runtime via a CALL $+5 / POP-register trick rather than hardcoded,
since this binary does not reliably load at its preferred base address;
every patch site is also checked against the PE's base-relocation table
and any conflicting entry is neutralized, since a hardcoded relocation
entry pointing into overwritten bytes corrupts them at load time
regardless of what replaced them.

# unconditionally reads the extension token (token[1]) of the split
# argument -- past the end of a one-element vector when no ".EXT" was
# typed -- and again after the match loop. Both reads crash or read
# garbage. Every command is protected in the shipped game ("cannot delete
# system file" for anything that matches), so DEL never deletes anything;
# this fix only removes the crash and reports the same protected message
# the developers' own code prints for the with-extension case.
#
# History: releases 0.3.0 through 0.3.8 also made DEL able to
# delete COM commands. That was a regression -- the original game never

# Fix 10: Full Stop, while docked, silently undocks the ship in every
# system's eyes except the game's own dock/undock bookkeeping (BUG-022).
# Ship::allStop unconditionally clears the docking-process state field as
# part of "come to a stop" -- every system gated on the general
# ShipData::checkIsDocked/checkNotDocked predicate (reactor start, waypoint
# plotting, plausibly more) immediately starts behaving as if the ship
# weren't docked, with no fee, no undocking permission check, and no
# airlock requirement ever evaluated, because the real Undock command never
# runs. Fix: skip that one write when the ship is still genuinely docked
# (checked via ship+0x178, the real docked-with pointer, confirmed via live
# repro to stay unchanged throughout the exploit) -- every other caller of
# allStop on a genuinely non-docked ship is unaffected.

# Fix 11: a save (or hand-edited ship data) referencing a module identifier
# that no longer resolves -- e.g. the pre-rename LADAR ids this same
# project's own BUG-018 fix renamed -- crashes on load, or (with only half
# this fix applied) hangs instead (BUG-023). Two independent bugs, both
# needed together:
#
#   (a) V12::loadShip dereferences V10::readShipModule's return value with
#       no null check -- an unresolvable identifier is a guaranteed
#       NULL-pointer crash.
#   (b) V10::readShipModule's own failure path (which already correctly
#       detects and logs the bad identifier) returns immediately after
#       just the identifier string, never consuming the 339 bytes of
#       trailing per-module data a resolved module's read would have --
#       permanently desyncing the save file's read position for every
#       remaining module and everything read after it. Fixing only (a)
#       replaces the crash with a hang instead (confirmed live) as the
#       desync cascades into a corrupted downstream loop count.
#
# Fixing both: the ship simply loads with that one module slot left empty,
# everything else -- remaining modules, contracts, gameplay -- unaffected.

# Fix 12: Commodities Trading Terminal shows a garbled "not enough pod
# space" error for a good that needs a special cargo pod (radiation-shielded
# or temperature-controlled) when there isn't enough free space in it.
#
# TradeEngine::currentCommodityPurchaseValid has two call sites for this
# error that use a two-`%s` format string ("%s`^Error: not enough `!%s
# `^space in your hold."). Both push the pod-type-name lookup and the
# market-price-comparison note in the wrong order for cdecl's right-to-left
# argument convention: the pod name lands in the leading `%s` (prepended
# before "Error:") and the price note lands inside "not enough ___ space in
# your hold." where the pod name belongs. A simpler sibling call site in the
# same function (single-`%s` template, used in an earlier pre-price check)
# puts the pod name in the right slot, confirming that's the intended
# position.
#
# Can't just reorder the two existing PUSH instructions in place: the
# pod-name table lookup (PUSH dword ptr [reg*4+0x5dfa98]) embeds an
# absolute address with its own base-relocation entry, and physically
# moving it to a new file offset would leave that entry pointing at the
# wrong bytes. Instead, cave-replace both push sequences with a
# PIC-addressed version (the usual CALL $+5/POP/ADD trick to get the
# table's base into a scratch register, then a register-relative
# [base_reg + index_reg*4] dereference -- no embedded absolute address, so
# no new relocation entry needed) that pushes the two values in the
# corrected order. See BUGS.md BUG-029 and docs/trading-terminal.md.

# Fix 13: "Quit to OS"/"Quit to Menu" never actually close/exit the game
# when connected as a LAN client -- the pause-menu click handler
# (Screen_Custom::clickOnObject) routes every command to the server while
# networked, and QUIT_TO_MENU/QUIT_TO_OS were never carved out of that
# routing even though they're purely client-local UI actions. The server
# runs its own local quit handler and shuts down cleanly (hence it looking
# "fixed" from the server side), but the client that actually clicked the
# button never runs its own handler and just sits on the pause menu.
#
# Fix: check the clicked command's id right where the function commits to
# the "networked, send to server" branch. For QUIT_TO_MENU (0xc2) or
# QUIT_TO_OS (0xc3), disconnect from the server first (via
# NetworkClient::disconnectFromServer directly -- the "official"
# doDisconnectFromServer wrapper gates on a UI submenu flag that's
# irrelevant here and silently no-ops from the plain pause menu), then jump
# into the same local-dispatch path the function already uses when not
# networked at all. Every other command id falls through to the original

# Fix 14: client crashes intermittently while dragging an installed addon
# from one component's addon slot onto another slot in the engineering
# repair screen. ShipInterface::doEngMoveComponent bounds-checks its
# destination slot index but not its source, which UI_ModuleRepair::
# dragOnto encodes the same way (main_slot_index + 100 for an addon-slot
# icon) -- an addon-sourced drag lets an unchecked index 400+ bytes past
# the module's 20-slot main-component array get read as a component
# pointer and dereferenced, the actual crash.
#
# An addon-to-* move isn't implemented anywhere in this function (it only
# ever touches the main-component array), so the correct, minimal fix
# mirrors what the destination side already does when *it's* addon-encoded:
# reject cleanly, no error message, no sound -- not a feature add, just
# closing the same gap the destination side was already closed on. See
# BUGS.md BUG-027 and docs/module-repair-system.md.

# TradeEngine::performModuleTransaction right after the module is installed
# and queues the email through the game's own EmailManager::addCustomEmail
# (the same call used for passenger and smuggler-reward mail, which arrives
# on the next comms sync), addressed from the module's own manufacturer
# (ShipModuleClass+0x38) with the subject "Your new <module name>"
# (ShipModuleClass+8) and the module's own email text as the body. Modules
# with no email text are skipped. Nothing here references an absolute

# Fix 18: clicking the posters in the Ceres Mk III cabin (or the desk PC in
# the Enceladus cabin, or the Proxima's equivalent) zooms the camera in, but
# the scroll wheel can't zoom back out. Those are the game's only
# cameraclick=true objects: they move the camera without focusing a screen,
# and PresentationInterface::onMouseScroll only backed out when a screen was
# focused (this+0x350). Fix: also back out when this+0x3b0 (current camera
# position, -1 = default view) != -1 -- the same test the Escape key uses.
# Rewrites a 72-byte block in place (no cave): room comes from replacing a
# 24-byte stack build of the cursor Vec2 argument with two PUSHes. See

# both compile GameLogic::resetShipsInScenario; the missing bounds-check
# exists in both binaries at different absolute addresses. Singleplayer
# never touches ois_server.exe (confirmed live -- only ois.exe runs), so
# this only matters for anyone hosting or joining a co-op game, where

# Fix 23: docking at a station (or jumping) in any scenario other than the story
# campaign overwrites save slot 1.  SaveHandler::saveGame only checks that a

# stand-alone scenarios (Convoy Attack, Survival, Stealth, Escape, Defend, the
# quickstart, ...) are also mode=full, and their scenariocat is absent, which
# the loader reads as "single".  The story scenario is the only one whose
# description says "This game auto-saves whenever you dock/undock or use a
# jumpgate" (scenariocat=story, ScenarioCategory 1 at Scenario+0x6C).
# Fix: also require the story category before saving.  Skipping the save also
# skips the Stats::storeStats call that follows it, so statistics from

# Fix 24: the power screen's "Drain (Normal)" figure disagrees with the sum of the
# modules' own drain figures (theoretical 1.65 vs actual 2.42).  Two causes:
#   1. SystemManager::totalPowerDrain adds up the modules' base drain without
#      the component power modifier (ComponentInterfaceInstance::getPowerModifier)
#      that ShipModule::getCurrentPowerDrain applies and the module screens show.
#   2. ShipModule::drainPower, what is really taken from the batteries, also
#      ignores that modifier, so the screens and the batteries disagree.
# Fix: totalPowerDrain now sums getCurrentPowerDrain over the module vector, and
# drainPower multiplies the amount it draws by (1 + modifier) before drawPower.
# ois.exe and ois_server.exe both carry the code (different addresses).

# ============================================================
# OPTIONAL VARIANT (--pds-everything): the point-defence system shoots
# everything in range.  Not applied by default -- it changes gameplay balance
# and is not a bug fix; it is here for people who want a PDS that works.
#
# Why the stock PDS never stops a torpedo (decompiled ShipModule::runLogic, the
# PDS branch, and GameData::getShipWithinDistance):
#   1. It picks the FIRST ship in the sector within range that has its IFF
#      transponder off (or is a weapon).  A weapon is only returned if nothing
#      earlier in the list qualified.
#   2. It "hits" by calling Ship::damage(angle, 100, heat, ...).  Ship::damage
#      returns immediately for vessel type 4 (torpedoes/probes/mines), so a lock
#      on a torpedo never harms it.  This is the actual bug.
#   3. Even where it works, it must roll 1 on the module's hit dice (1d6 on a
#      PDL 101) once per reload.
# What this variant changes:
#   * selection: weapons first (never your own), then ordinary ships whose IFF
#     transponder is OFF -- never ships with IFF on, stations or jump gates, never
#     a ship that is docked, never yourself
#   * a locked torpedo/probe/mine is destroyed (no hit roll, no warhead blast);
#     ships still take the stock heat damage and still need the hit roll
#   * enemy countermeasure decoys (not your own) are shot when nothing else is
#     in range
# Caves generated by tools/pds/asm_pds.py (assembly source lives there); every
# external target is a rel32 resolved here, so nothing is absolute / relocated.
# Client and server share the code layout, only the addresses differ.

# ============================================================
# OPTIONAL VARIANT (--civilians-comply): civilians give in to a cargo demand far
# more readily, and can be hailed again afterwards.  Not applied by default.
#
# From the decompiled ShipBehaviour::respondToPirateDemand (called when you pick
# "Drop your cargo or be fired upon." on a hail):
#   * A civilian (craft purpose 1) rolls rand()%100+1 <= chance.  The base chance
#     comes from the table `dropCargoChance`, indexed by the captain's STYLE (data key
#     `captainstyle=`; 0 cautious, 1 moderate, 2 reckless, 3 vreckless): {100, 90, 60, 15}.
#     Cargo amount, cargo value and smuggling are NOT part of the roll.  If your IFF is on it is forced to 2%; beyond 120 units it
#     is cut to two thirds, beyond 180 units to 5%.
#   * If the civilian's own sensors hold a weapon contact within 100 units, the
#     chance becomes table*1.5 (max 100).  Otherwise a failed roll says "We'll
#     believe it when we see a torpedo." -- even if you have just fired one the
#     civilian cannot see yet.
#   * The first thing the function does is add your registration to a list on the
#     civilian ship; PrivateCommsManager::switchTo refuses to open a conversation
#     with any ship whose list contains you.  So after one demand, answered or
#     not, you can never hail that ship again.
# What this variant changes:
#   1. dropCargoChance {100, 90, 60, 15} -> {100, 90, 70, 35} (reckless +10, vreckless +20)
#   2. a torpedo/probe/mine YOU launched that is still in flight within 250 units
#      of the civilian counts as seen, whatever the civilian's sensors say
#   3. the registration is no longer added to that list, so you can hail again
# The rolls, the IFF-on rule, the distance penalties and everything pirates and
# authorities do are untouched.  Client and server share the layout.

# The final-waypoint "decelerate" state (travel state 4) brakes by facing
# (angle to the waypoint + 180) and burning while the stopping distance is >= the
# distance left.  That is only a retro burn while the ship still heads for the
# waypoint.  Once it has flown past it (a fast engine does, e.g. the GX Delta at
# 100%) the angle flips, the same heading points along the velocity and the burn
# accelerates the ship away, draining the batteries.  Fix: use the dot product of
# the velocity with the vector to the waypoint; if the ship is moving away it
# faces the waypoint (a real retro burn), otherwise the heading is the stock one.

# Two hard constraints shape this:
#
#   1. A pull replaces the very code that is running, including
#      apply_data_fixes.py, which was imported at startup. Python does
#      not reload either from disk mid-run, so pulling and then
#      continuing would apply the OLD fixes while reporting the NEW
#      version. Every successful pull therefore re-runs the script as a
#      fresh process and exits; nothing continues in-process.
#   2. Pulling is running someone else's new code on the user's
#      machine. That gets asked about, not assumed. --yes deliberately
#      does NOT imply consent here; --update does.
